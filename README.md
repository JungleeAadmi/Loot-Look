LootLook (Bookmark Manager & Price Tracker)

LootLook is a self-hosted "Smart Bookmark" manager. While it functions as a beautiful way to organize links from the web, its core engine silently monitors e-commerce bookmarks (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, etc.) for price changes, keeping a history and alerting you of drops.

🚀 Usage

Install: Run bash install.sh (or npm install in backend/frontend folders).

Run Backend: cd backend && npm start
