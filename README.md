LootLook (Bookmark Manager & Price Tracker)

LootLook is a self-hosted "Smart Bookmark" manager. While it functions as a beautiful way to organize links from the web, its core engine silently monitors e-commerce bookmarks (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, etc.) for price changes, keeping a history and alerting you of drops.
